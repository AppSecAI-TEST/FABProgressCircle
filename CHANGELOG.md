Update 1.01
-----------
* Fixed a little bug in ProgressArcDrawable bounds which caused the arc to get drawn behind the fab in some cases.
* Added `app:circleSize` custom attribute with values `normal` or `mini` to fix some layout weird measures.
* Added custom attribute `app:roundedStroke="true"` to allow a rounded stroke on the progress circle heads.
* Added custom attribute `app:reusable="true"` to reset the FABProgressCircle after completion animation.
